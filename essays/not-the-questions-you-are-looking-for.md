The ability to ask pointed, articulate, and well thought out questions is in my opinion a necessary skill for any self-respecting human being to develop. For technical professionals like software engineers, nurturing this ability is even more critical. As an aspiring developer, I have experienced numerous occasions upon which I found myself just outside of my area of current expertise. Many times, when attempting to learn a new programming language with foreign language constructs and semantics, I would find myself unable to easily ascertain the reasons why specific components of my programs written in these languages were failing. In times such as these, I have come to learn that Stack Overflow can be an excellent resource. I am typically able to track down Q&A threads that are either directly or closely related to the specific issue that I am personally experiencing. By simply passively browsing through such threads, and following up on links to other documentation posted by helpful Stack Overflow users, I am more often than not able to find a solution to my problem.

While I have never mustered up the courage ask a question directly on Stack Overflow, I have frequented the site enough to witness many attempts at asking technical questions, both good and bad. In his document titled <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html#code">How to Ask Questions The Smart Way</a>, Eric Raymond outlines the criteria for what makes a question a "smart question" versus a "not so smart question." Reading this paper has proven to be an illuminating experience for me, and I would like to take this opportunity to analyze two examples of questions from Stack Overflow in the context of Eric Raymond's comprehensive treatise on smart questions. My hope is that this analysis will provide insight into the teachings of Raymond with concrete examples.

## The Smart Side
A "smart question" is concise, informative, and shows evidence that the inquirer has done their own research prior to reaching out. Adherents of the "smart side" present their queries in a manner that is clear and compact, while demonstrating a level of insight into the specific issue that they are experiencing. Posing questions in this fashion is especially important when the object of the question is related to a bug or unexpected behavior in source code. Take the following <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6841333/why-is-subtracting-these-two-times-in-1927-giving-a-strange-result">highly rated question>/a> from stack overflow. This question exhibits many of the qualities which Raymond asserts are representative of a "smart" code related question. The question is related to an unexpected result produced when subtracting two times that are only 1 second apart in Java. The question is crafted so that the minimal amount of code needed to demonstrate the issue is presented, a mere 8 lines of code packaged into a java main function. The author then highlights the exact line of code that is producing the deviation, as well as both the expected and actual results of the program. This question has been upvoted 5698 times and favorited 1365 times. Additionally, the top rated answer exemplifies 

## The Not Smart Side
