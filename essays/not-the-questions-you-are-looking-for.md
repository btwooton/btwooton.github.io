The ability to ask pointed, articulate, and well thought out questions is in my opinion a necessary skill for any self-respecting adult to develop. For technical professionals and software engineers, nurturing this ability is even more critical. As an aspiring software developer, I have experienced numerous occasions upon which I found myself just outside of my area of current expertise. Many times, when attempting to learn a new programming language with foreign language constructs and semantics, I would find myself unable to easily ascertain the reasons why specific components of my programs written in these languages were failing. In times such as these, I have come to learn that online Q&A platforms such as Stack Overflow can be an excellent resource. I am typically able to track down Q&A threads that are either directly or closely related to the specific issue that I am experiencing. By passively browsing through such threads, and following up on links to other documentation posted by helpful users, I am more often than not able to find a solution to my problem.

While I have never mustered up the courage ask a question directly on Stack Overflow, I have frequented the site enough to witness many attempts at asking technical questions, both good and bad. In his document titled <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html#code">How to Ask Questions The Smart Way</a>, Eric Raymond outlines the criteria for what makes a question a "smart question" versus a "not so smart question." Reading this paper has proven to be an illuminating experience for me, and I would like to take this opportunity to analyze two examples of questions from Stack Overflow in the context of Eric Raymond's comprehensive treatise on smart questions.

## The Smart Side

A "smart question" is concise, explicit, and intimates that the inquirer has done their own research prior to reaching out. Adherents of the "smart side" present their queries in a manner that is both clear and compact, while demonstrating a level of insight into the specific issue that they are experiencing. Posing a question in this fashion is critical when the subject of that question happens to be a bug, or otherwise unexpected behavior in source code. Take the following <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6841333/why-is-subtracting-these-two-times-in-1927-giving-a-strange-result">highly rated question</a> from stack overflow. This question exhibits many of the qualities which Raymond presents as representative of a "smart" code related question. The question is related to an unexpected result in a Java program utilizing the java.util.Timezone API. The anomally is produced when subtracting two times from 1927 that should only be 1 second apart, producing a surprising result of 353 seconds. The inquirer has crafted this question such that the minimal amount of code needed to demonstrate their technical issue is presented, a mere 8 lines of code packaged into a java main function. They then highlight the exact line of code that is producing the deviation, as well as both the expected and actual results of the program. This question has been upvoted 5698 times and favorited 1365 times. Additionally, the top rated answer exemplifies the positive outcomes that can result when a question is posed in the "smart" way. As it turns out, this discrepency between the expected and actual differences between the two times is the result of a time zone change that took place on December 31st, 1927 in Shanghai China. As a consequence of this time zone change, the specified datapoint "1927-12-31 23:54:08" actually occured twice, leading to this discrepancy. As a positive side effect of the OP having posed their question in a "smart" style, this particular Q&A thread has developed into an excellent learning tool for hackers who frequent Stack Overflow. This particular thread highlights how inconsistencies can easily arise when software leverages APIs that operate on real world data. 

## The Not Smart Side
<img class="ui medium right rounded floated image" src="../images/question-jedi.jpg">
A "not so smart question" is presumptious, long-winded, and is indicative of the inquirer having devoted little to no effort to solving his/her issue prior to begging for help. Those who succumb to the "not smart side" can expect to be ridiculed, reprimanded, and outright ignored by hackers and experienced users, who are quick recognize such individuals as being veritable timesinks. A question that I find exemplary of the "not smart" paradigm is the following <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48435725/why-is-this-c-program-throwing-a-segmentation-fault-after-taking-user-input">poorly rated and closed question</a> taken from Stack Overflow. The person who posed this question clearly did so under the assumption that some jedi master programmer was going to come along and track down their bug for them. After lazily stating that their C program is throwing a segmentation fault, the inquirer then decided to post the entire contents of their program source code, including a pile of functions having nothing to do with the specified bug. To make matters worse, the inquirer acknowledged that a debugging session in GDB would have likely tracked down this issue, but admitted to essentially being too lazy to install and run GDB on their own. As a direct result of being poorly crafted, this question was downvoted 6 times, and eventually closed by the Stack Overflow community. To add insult to injury, a responder stated that the asker should fix the issue of not having GDB installed by "loading a debugger and using it." I was able to follow the development of this Stack Overflow thread in real time, from its initial posting, to being downvoted and ultimately closed within a matter of hours. After having read Raymond's paper on smart questions, I was able to predict the negative outcome of this particular inquiry with a surprising degree of accuracy. The response from user Martin James in particular took the words right out of my mouth. If your C program is having a segmentation fault, and you are unsure of its exact cause, you should maybe think about installing a debugger like GDB, compiling your source with debugging flags set, and tracking it down yourself. Needless to say, I felt that this "not so smart" query elicited just the sort of response that it deserved.

In closing, I would like to breifly state that I do not intend the words contained in this document to be viewed as a form of ridicule against particular Stack Overflow users. Instead, my hope is that this essay can serve as a small case study into the outcomes, both positive and negative, that can arise from Q&A threads posted on sites such as Stack Overflow. I hope to highlight that said outcomes are directly influenced by the level of clarity and maturity displayed by the inquirer, and that this should serve as an important lesson to those who should decide to post questions of their own on Stack Overflow. As for myself, I feel that conducting this study has helped me to internalize Eric Raymond's teachings on "smart questions", and given me the confidence and knowledge that I will need to begin posing questions of my own to online hacker communities.
